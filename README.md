# SysAdminScripts
This is a collection of deployable scripts I made in an effort to manage services in a VPS (mainly VOIP and game servers) and to learn scripting and administration. This repository is to ease my usage of this "framework", but anyone who can take advantage of this as a tool or reference is free to do so.

## Structure
TODO: Add basic file structure description

##TODO:
- Convert TeamSpeak to use screen model
- Make script fully deployable (download steamCMD at least)
- More organization
- Rename cron folder, make different types of scripts more clear, add more information to README
